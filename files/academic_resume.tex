\nohyphens{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Research Interests}}
& As Moore’s Law fades, what will be the next-generation AI system that can overcome the conflict between surging computational needs and scarce hardware resources? Inspired by this question, my current research focuses on building low-cost, high-efficiency machine learning systems that can be deployed to serve a wide range of scenarios.
\vspace{0.01\textwidth} \\
& Specifically, I identify performance bottlenecks, opportunities, and challenges in the system, and leverage technologies such as online learning to address the performance- and resource-oriented problems. My works aim to harness hardware resources, automate the operation of complex systems, and enhance the efficiency of systems (e.g., retrieval augmented generation). \\
